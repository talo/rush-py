# Quickstart

This document will walk through executing jobs on the Rush platform, by
demonstrating how to prepare a protein. For a comprehensive guide on the
concepts and constructing a full workflow, see the [full rush-py
explainer](https://talo.github.io/rush-py/full-rush-py-explainer.html)
document.

First, install the following modules via pip—we require Python ≥ 3.9:

    pip install rush-py pdb-tools

# 0) Code Sample

See the detailed breakdown in sections.

``` python
# Get a pdb to work with - we use the pdb-tools cli here
# but you can download directly from rcsb.org
!pdb_fetch '1brs' | pdb_selchain -A | pdb_delhetatm > '1B39_A_nohet.pdb'
```

``` python
# ...import the dependencies and set your configuration
from pathlib import Path
import rush

os.environ["RUSH_TOKEN"] = YOUR_TOKEN

# 1.3 Build your client
client = rush.build_blocking_provider_with_functions()

# 2.1 Prepare the protein
prepared_protein_qdxf, prepared_protein_pdb = client.prepare_protein(
    Path("1B39_A_nohet.pdb"), tags=["example_prep"]
)

# 2.3 Return run values
print(prepared_protein_qdxf.download(overwrite=True).open().read()[0:50], "...")
```

# 1) Setup

This is where we prepare the rush client, directories, and input data
we’ll be working with.

## 1.0) Imports

``` python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from pdbtools import pdb_delhetatm, pdb_fetch, pdb_selchain

import rush
```

## 1.1) Credentials

Retrieve your API token from the [Rush
UI](https://rush.qdx.co/dashboard/settings).

You can either set the `RUSH_URL` and `RUSH_TOKEN` environment variables
or provide them as variables to the client directly.

To see how to set environment variables,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) has an
extensive article.

``` python
os.environ["RUSH_TOKEN"] = YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 1.2) Configuration

Lets set some global variables that define our project. These are not
required, but are good practice to help organize the jobs that will be
persisted under your account.

Make sure you create a unique set of tags for each run. Good practice is
to have at least each of the experiment name and system name as a tag.

``` python
EXPERIMENT = "rush-py-quickstart"
SYSTEM = "1B39"
TAGS = ["qdx", EXPERIMENT, SYSTEM]
```

## 1.3) Build your client

Get our client, which we’ll use for calling modules and generally for
using the Rush API.

As mentioned earlier, `url` and `access_token` are optional if you have
set the env variables `RUSH_URL` and `RUSH_TOKEN` respectively.

`batch_tags` will be applied to each run that is spawned by this client.

A folder called `.rush` will be created in your workspace directory
(defaults to the current working directory, can be overridden by passing
`workspace=` to the provider builder).

``` python
# By using the `build_provider_with_functions` method,
# we will also build helper functions calling each module
client = rush.build_blocking_provider_with_functions(batch_tags=TAGS)
```

    2024-03-21 14:31:32,815 - rush - INFO - Restoring by default via env

## 1.4) Input selection

Fetch a pdb from RCSB, stripping hetatoms and selecting a single chain
to pass as input to the modules:

``` python
PROTEIN_PDB_PATH = client.workspace / f"{SYSTEM}_P.pdb"

complex = list(pdb_fetch.fetch_structure(SYSTEM))
protein = pdb_delhetatm.remove_hetatm(pdb_selchain.select_chain(complex, "A"))
with open(PROTEIN_PDB_PATH, "w") as f:
    for l in protein:
        f.write(str(l))
```

# 2) Running Rush Modules

You can view which modules are available, alongside their documentation,
in the [API Documentation](https://talo.github.io/rush-py/api/).

## 2.0) Prep the protein

First we will run the protein preparation routine (using pdbfixer and
pdb2pqr internally) to prepare the protein for a molecular dynamics
simulation.

``` python
# we can check the arguments and outputs for prepare_protein with help()
help(client.prepare_protein)
```

    Help on function prepare_protein in module rush.provider:

    prepare_protein(*args: *tuple[RushObject[bytes]], target: 'Target | None' = None, resources: 'Resources | None' = None, tags: 'list[str] | None' = None, restore: 'bool | None' = None) -> tuple[RushObject[list[Record]], RushObject[bytes]]
        Prepare a PDB for downstream tasks: protonate, fill missing atoms, etc.

        Module version:
        `github:talo/prepare_protein/947cdbc000031e192153a20a9b4a8fbb12279102#prepare_protein_tengu`

        QDX Type Description:

            input_pdb: Object[@$Bytes]
            ->
            output_qdxf: Object[[Conformer]];
            output_pdb: Object[@$Bytes]


        :param input_pdb: An input protein as a file; one PDB file
        :return output_qdxf: An output protein a vec: one qdxf per model in pdb
        :return output_pdb: An output protein as a file: one PDB file

``` python
# Here we run the function, it will return a Provider.Arg which you can use to
# fetch the results
# We set restore = True so that we can restore a previous run to the same path
# with the same tags
prepared_protein_qdxf, prepared_protein_pdb = client.prepare_protein(
    PROTEIN_PDB_PATH,
)
# This initially only has the id of your result; we will show how to fetch the
# actual value later
prepared_protein_qdxf
```

## 2.1) Run statuses

This will show the status of all of your runs. You can also view run
statuses on the [Rush UI](https://rush.qdx.co/dashboard/jobs).

``` python
client.status()
```

    {}

## 2.2) Run Values

This will return the “value” of the output from the function—for files
you will recieve a url that you can download, otherwise you will recieve
them as python types:

``` python
protein_qdxf_info = prepared_protein_qdxf.get()
protein_qdxf_info
```

    Blocking get

    'https://storage.googleapis.com/rush_store_default/af08031b-e871-45e2-a226-e8c7e1fd5719?x-goog-signature=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&x-goog-algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&x-goog-credential=qdx-store-user%40humming-bird-321603.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20240321%2Fasia-southeast1%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&x-goog-date=20240321T063139Z&x-goog-expires=3600&x-goog-signedheaders=host'

## 2.3) Downloads

We provide a utility to download files into your workspace, you can
either provide a filename, which will be saved in
`workspace/objects/[filename]`, or you can provide your own filepath
which the client will use as-is:

``` python
protein_qdxf_file = prepared_protein_qdxf.download(overwrite=True)
```

``` python
# qdxf files can be loaded as json
with open(protein_qdxf_file) as f:
    protein_qdxf_data = json.load(f)[0]
protein_qdxf_data["amino_acid_seq"][:10]
```

    ['MET', 'GLU', 'ASN', 'PHE', 'GLN', 'LYS', 'VAL', 'GLU', 'LYS', 'ILE']

``` python
prepared_protein_pdb.download(filename="01_prepared_protein.pdb", overwrite=True)
```

    PosixPath('/home/machineer/qdx/rush-py-quickstart/objects/01_prepared_protein.pdb')

``` python
# we can read our prepared protein pdb like this
with open(client.workspace / "objects" / "01_prepared_protein.pdb", "r") as f:
    print(f.readline(), "...")
```
